## Variant Components

### Test/Development Versions
1. **AdvancedDesignerV3Test.tsx** - Testing version
2. **AdvancedDesignerV3Simple.tsx** - Simplified version
3. **AdvancedDesignerV3Minimal.tsx** - Minimal feature set
4. **AdvancedDesignerV3Fixed.tsx** - Bug fix version

## Related Components

### Support Components
1. **GreenhouseProfessionalUI.tsx** - Professional greenhouse design interface
2. **Safe3DWrapper.tsx** - Error boundary for 3D components
3. **BIMImportDialog.tsx** - BIM file import
4. **BIMPropertiesPanel.tsx** - BIM properties editor
5. **EmergencyLightingPanel.tsx** - Emergency lighting configuration
6. **SpectrumVisualizationPanel.tsx** - Spectrum analysis display

## Issues and Redundancy

### 1. **Version Proliferation**
- Multiple versions (V2, V3, V3Working, V4) create confusion
- Unclear which version should be used
- Code duplication across versions

### 2. **Component Size**
- AdvancedDesignerV3 is 37,000+ tokens (too large)
- V3Working is also very large (200+ component imports)
- Should be split into smaller, focused components

### 3. **Naming Confusion**
- "V3Working" suggests instability
- Multiple "V3" variants with different suffixes
- No clear versioning strategy

### 4. **Feature Duplication**
- Similar features implemented differently across versions
- No clear feature matrix showing differences
- Redundant calculation engines

### 5. **Route Confusion**
- Multiple routes for different designer versions
- `/design/advanced-v3/`
- `/design/svg/`
- `/design/minimal/`
- `/design/test-component/`
- No clear primary route

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Consolidate to Single Version**
   - Use AdvancedDesignerV3Working as the base
   - Rename to simply "AdvancedDesigner"
   - Archive other versions

2. **Clean Up Routes**
   - Single primary route: `/design/`
   - Move experimental versions to `/design/experimental/`
   - Remove test routes from production

3. **Refactor Large Components**
   - Split AdvancedDesignerV3Working into:
     - DesignerCanvas (2D rendering)
     - Designer3DView (3D rendering)
     - DesignerToolbar (tools and controls)
     - DesignerSidebar (object properties)
     - DesignerAnalysis (calculations)

4. **Create Feature Matrix**
   - Document which features belong in which version
   - Clear upgrade path between versions
   - Feature flags for experimental features

### Long-term Strategy
1. **Version Management**
   - Use feature flags instead of file versions
   - Single codebase with configurable features
   - Proper semantic versioning

2. **Component Architecture**
   - Implement plugin architecture
   - Lazy-load advanced features
   - Shared calculation engine

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Code splitting for large features
   - Web Workers for calculations
   - Virtual scrolling for object lists

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for calculations
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - E2E tests for critical paths

## Conclusion

The designer components show a pattern of iterative development with multiple versions created to fix issues or add features. This has led to significant technical debt with code duplication, naming confusion, and maintenance challenges. The primary focus should be consolidating to a single, well-architected designer component with proper feature management and clear separation of concerns.

The AdvancedDesignerV3Working component should be refactored and renamed as the primary designer, with other versions archived or removed. The component should be split into smaller, manageable pieces with clear interfaces and shared utilities.
