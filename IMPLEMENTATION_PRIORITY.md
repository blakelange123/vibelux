- Complete OAuth2 flow
- Sync invoices/expenses
- Financial reporting
```

### 3. Marketplace Platform üõçÔ∏è

- Commission handling
```

### 4. AI/ML Features (Make Real) ü§ñ
Move from mockups to working implementations:

```typescript
// src/lib/ml/yield-predictor.ts
- Implement actual TensorFlow model
- Connect to real sensor data
- Build training pipeline
- Create accuracy metrics
```

### 5. Testing & Documentation üìö
Professional platforms need:
- 80%+ test coverage
- Complete API documentation
- Security audits
- Performance benchmarks

## What NOT to Do
