# Revenue Sharing Implementation Roadmap

## Current Status
The revenue sharing pricing models and calculations are built, but the real-time tracking and automation systems are missing.

## Phase 1: Data Collection Infrastructure (4-6 weeks)

### 1.1 Sensor Integration
- [ ] Connect to environmental sensors (temp, humidity, CO2, light)
- [ ] Integrate with power meters for energy tracking
- [ ] Connect to yield tracking systems
- [ ] Set up data pipeline and storage

### 1.2 Baseline System
- [ ] Build baseline data import wizard
- [ ] Create baseline verification workflows
- [ ] Implement weather normalization algorithms
- [ ] Add third-party auditor integration

### 1.3 API Integrations
- [ ] Utility company APIs for energy data
- [ ] Weather data APIs for normalization
- [ ] Equipment monitoring APIs
- [ ] METRC/compliance system APIs

## Phase 2: Real-Time Dashboard (4-6 weeks)

### 2.1 Performance Tracking Dashboard
```typescript
// Components needed:
- /src/components/revenue-sharing/PerformanceDashboard.tsx
- /src/components/revenue-sharing/SavingsChart.tsx
- /src/components/revenue-sharing/BaselineComparison.tsx
- /src/components/revenue-sharing/RevenueShareBreakdown.tsx
```

### 2.2 Key Metrics Display
- [ ] Real-time energy consumption vs baseline
- [ ] Yield performance tracking
- [ ] Current month savings calculation
- [ ] Revenue share breakdown
- [ ] Historical trends and projections

### 2.3 Reporting Features
- [ ] Monthly performance reports
- [ ] Audit trail access
- [ ] Export functionality
- [ ] Dispute management interface

## Phase 3: Billing Automation (3-4 weeks)

### 3.1 Payment Integration
- [ ] Stripe Connect for revenue sharing
- [ ] Automated monthly billing
- [ ] Invoice generation with breakdowns
- [ ] Payment method management

### 3.2 Billing Logic
```typescript
// New services needed:
- /src/services/billing/RevenueShareBilling.ts
- /src/services/billing/PerformanceCalculator.ts
- /src/services/billing/InvoiceGenerator.ts
```

### 3.3 Reconciliation System
- [ ] Monthly closing process
- [ ] Dispute handling workflow
- [ ] Adjustment mechanisms
- [ ] Audit reports

## Phase 4: AI Optimization (6-8 weeks)

### 4.1 Optimization Engine
- [ ] Machine learning models for energy optimization
- [ ] Yield prediction algorithms
- [ ] Automated control adjustments
- [ ] A/B testing framework

### 4.2 Control Systems
- [ ] Lighting schedule optimization
- [ ] HVAC control algorithms
- [ ] Irrigation optimization
- [ ] Demand response automation

## Phase 5: Customer Experience (2-3 weeks)

### 5.1 Onboarding Flow
- [ ] Baseline data collection wizard
- [ ] Equipment inventory setup
- [ ] Performance goal setting
- [ ] Contract configuration

### 5.2 Customer Portal
- [ ] Performance insights dashboard
- [ ] Savings simulator updates
- [ ] Support ticket integration
- [ ] Knowledge base

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Infrastructure
```yaml
Required Services:
- Time-series database (InfluxDB/TimescaleDB)
- Real-time data processing (Apache Kafka/AWS Kinesis)
- ML pipeline (AWS SageMaker/Google AI Platform)
- Billing service (Stripe/custom)
```

### API Endpoints Needed
```typescript
// Revenue Sharing APIs
POST   /api/revenue-sharing/baseline
GET    /api/revenue-sharing/performance
GET    /api/revenue-sharing/savings
POST   /api/revenue-sharing/billing/calculate
GET    /api/revenue-sharing/reports
```

### Database Schema
```sql
-- New tables needed
CREATE TABLE baselines (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  facility_id UUID,
  metric_type VARCHAR,
  baseline_value NUMERIC,
  measurement_unit VARCHAR,
  effective_date DATE,
  verification_status VARCHAR
);

CREATE TABLE performance_metrics (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  facility_id UUID,
  metric_type VARCHAR,
  actual_value NUMERIC,
  baseline_value NUMERIC,
  savings_amount NUMERIC,
  measurement_date TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE revenue_share_bills (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  facility_id UUID,
  billing_period VARCHAR,
  total_savings NUMERIC,
  revenue_share_amount NUMERIC,
  status VARCHAR,
  paid_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Estimated Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 19-27 weeks (5-7 months)
- **MVP** (Phases 1-3): 11-16 weeks
- **Full Feature Set**: Additional 8-11 weeks

## Investment Required
- **Engineering**: 4-6 developers for 6 months
- **Data Infrastructure**: $20-40k/month
- **Third-party APIs**: $5-10k/month
- **Total Budget**: $500k-800k

## Success Metrics
1. **Accuracy**: Â±5% variance in savings calculations
2. **Uptime**: 99.9% for tracking systems
3. **Customer Satisfaction**: >90% trust in calculations
4. **Payment Success**: >95% on-time payments
5. **Optimization Results**: >20% average savings achieved

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize sensor integration partnerships
2. Design real-time dashboard mockups
3. Select time-series database solution
4. Begin Stripe integration planning
5. Recruit ML engineer for optimization engine
