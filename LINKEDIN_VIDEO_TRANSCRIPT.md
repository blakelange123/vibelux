## Opening (0:00-0:10)
*[Camera on speaker, professional setting with plants/grow lights visible in background]*

"Hey LinkedIn community! I'm incredibly excited to share something I've been working on for the past few years that's finally ready for the world."

## The Problem (0:10-0:30)
*[B-roll: Traditional cultivation facilities, manual processes]*

"If you've ever worked in controlled environment agriculture, you know the challenges: Complex lighting calculations done on spreadsheets, disconnected systems that don't talk to each other, and millions of dollars in equipment decisions made with incomplete data."

## Introducing Vibelux (0:30-0:50)
*[Screen recording: Vibelux platform demo]*

"That's why we built Vibelux - the first truly comprehensive cultivation intelligence platform. It's not just another grow app. It's an entire ecosystem that brings together 3D facility design, AI-powered recommendations, real-time monitoring, and business intelligence into one unified platform."

## Key Features (0:50-1:20)
*[Quick demo clips of each feature]*

"With Vibelux, you can:
- Design your entire facility in 3D and calculate PPFD values instantly
- Get AI-powered recommendations for optimal light recipes and environmental setpoints
- Monitor and control every aspect of your operation from anywhere
- Predict yields with machine learning models trained on real cultivation data
- Even connect with other growers through our B2B marketplace

And here's the game-changer - our AutoPilot system can actually run your facility autonomously, making micro-adjustments 24/7 to optimize for yield, quality, or energy efficiency."

## The Journey (1:20-1:40)
*[Personal shot of speaker]*

"This started as a simple tool to help growers with lighting calculations. But after talking to hundreds of cultivators, facility designers, and equipment manufacturers, we realized the industry needed something much bigger. So we built it."

## Results & Validation (1:40-2:00)
*[Data visualization/testimonial graphics]*

"Early users are seeing 15-20% increases in yield, 30% reduction in energy costs, and most importantly - they're spending less time on spreadsheets and more time growing amazing plants."

## Call to Action (2:00-2:20)
