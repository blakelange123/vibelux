# VibeLux Integration-Based Business Model

## Overview
VibeLux operates as an **intelligent optimization layer** that integrates with existing control systems rather than replacing them. This dramatically reduces barriers to adoption and leverages existing infrastructure.

## How It Works

### 1. **Integration Architecture**
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│   VibeLux Cloud     │  ← AI Optimization Engine
│  (Claude Opus AI)   │  ← Energy Algorithms  
│   Analytics & UI    │  ← Customer Portal
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │ API/Protocol Integration
           ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Existing Control    │  ← Argus, Priva, TrolMaster, etc.
│     Systems         │  ← Already installed & working
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │ Direct Control
           ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Lighting & HVAC     │  ← No changes needed
│    Hardware         │  ← Use existing equipment
└─────────────────────┘
```
