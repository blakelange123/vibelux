# AI Assistant Fixes - Dimension and PPFD Parsing

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Dimension Parsing
**Problem**: AI assistant couldn't parse dimensions like "2' x 20'" correctly
**Solution**: Enhanced regex patterns to handle multiple formats:
- `2' x 20'` (with apostrophes)
- `2 x 20` (plain numbers)
- `2 by 20` (using "by")
- `2 feet by 20 feet` (with units)
- `2'x20'` (no spaces)

### 2. PPFD Parsing
**Problem**: AI assistant wasn't correctly extracting PPFD values (e.g., 100 PPFD was heard as 200 PPFD)
**Solution**: Added multiple pattern matching for PPFD:
- `100 ppfd`
- `ppfd of 100`
- `100 μmol/m²/s`
- `target ppfd: 100`

### 3. Multi-tier Specifications
**Problem**: Multi-tier rack specifications weren't parsed correctly
**Solution**: Enhanced tier detection patterns:
- `8 layers tall`
- `4 tier rack`
- `4-tier`
- `tiers: 4`
- Defaults to 3 tiers when "multi" or "multiple" is mentioned

### 4. DLC Fixture Requests
**Problem**: No support for DLC-specific fixture requests
**Solution**: Added detection for:
- "dlc" or "dlc certified" keywords
- Fixture type preferences (bar, panel, toplighting)

### 5. AI Context Updates
**Problem**: AI wasn't aware of current designer features
**Solution**: Updated VIBELUX_CONTEXT with:
- Dimension parsing guidelines
- Current Advanced Designer v3 features
- Instructions to always confirm dimensions and PPFD
- Multi-tier rack system capabilities

## Files Modified

1. `/src/components/AIAssistant.tsx`
   - Enhanced `extractDesignParameters()` function
   - Added debug logging
   - Support for DLC fixture requests
   - Fixed tier detection edge cases

2. `/src/app/api/ai-assistant/route.ts`
   - Updated VIBELUX_CONTEXT with parsing notes
   - Added instructions to confirm dimensions
   - Listed current designer features

3. `/src/app/api/ai-assistant/generate-design/route.ts`
   - Added support for DLC fixture requests
   - Added fixture type preferences

## Testing Results

Created comprehensive test suite that verified:
- ✅ Various dimension formats parse correctly
- ✅ PPFD values extracted accurately
- ✅ Multi-tier specifications work
- ✅ Default values applied appropriately

## How to Verify

1. Open the AI Assistant in the designer
2. Try these test prompts:
   - "Design a 2' x 20' rack with 100 PPFD"
   - "Create lighting for 4x8 rack 8 layers tall with 200 ppfd"
   - "I need DLC certified fixtures for a 10x20 room targeting 300 ppfd"

The AI should now:
- Correctly repeat back the dimensions
- Use the right PPFD target
- Generate appropriate multi-tier designs
- Select DLC fixtures when requested
