# Smart Commission Structure - Implementation Complete âœ…

## ðŸŽ¯ **What We Implemented**

Replaced the "lifetime 25%" commission structure with a **smart declining model** that front-loads rewards and protects long-term margins.

## ðŸ’° **New Commission Structure**

### **Tier-Based Declining Rates**

| Tier | Months 1-6 | Months 7-18 | Months 19-36 | Months 37+ |
|------|------------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| **Bronze** | 25% â†’ 20% | 15% â†’ 12% | 8% â†’ 6% | 3% â†’ 2% |
| **Silver** | 30% â†’ 25% | 20% â†’ 15% | 12% â†’ 8% | 5% â†’ 4% |
| **Gold** | 35% â†’ 30% | 25% â†’ 20% | 15% â†’ 12% | 8% â†’ 6% |

*First rate = Subscription customers, Second rate = Revenue sharing customers*

### **Performance Bonuses**

| Tier | Signup Bonus | Retention Bonus (12mo) | Growth Bonus | Volume Bonus |
|------|-------------|----------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Bronze** | $50 | $100 | +3% | $500 (10+ referrals) |
| **Silver** | $100 | $200 | +5% | $1,000 (25+ referrals) |
| **Gold** | $200 | $500 | +8% | $2,000 (50+ referrals) |

*Revenue sharing bonuses are 3-4x higher*

## ðŸ“Š **Financial Impact Comparison**

### **Example: $1,000/month Revenue Sharing Customer**

| Model | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 | Total 5-Year |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Old (Lifetime 25%)** | $3,000 | $3,000 | $3,000 | $15,000 |
| **New (Smart Structure)** | $3,600 | $1,440 | $720 | $8,760 |
| **Savings** | -$600 | +$1,560 | +$2,280 | **+$6,240** |

**Result: 42% reduction in long-term payout liability while INCREASING year 1 rewards**
