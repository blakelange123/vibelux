# Greenhouse 3D Rendering - Fixed

## What Was Wrong
1. Complex geometry (TubeGeometry with EllipseCurve) was causing NaN errors
2. Duplicate/corrupted code was mixed into the file
3. Overly transparent materials made the structure invisible

## What Was Fixed
1. **Simplified greenhouse structure** - Replaced complex arch geometry with simple peaked roof design
2. **Cleaned up file** - Removed ~190 lines of duplicate/corrupted code
3. **Better materials** - Used more visible materials for glass panels (20% opacity) and frame (gray metallic)
4. **Clear structure** - Simple geometry using boxes and planes that won't cause computational errors

## The New Greenhouse Design
- **Frame**: Gray metallic corner posts, ridge beam, and gutters
- **Walls**: Transparent blue-tinted glass panels (20% opacity)
- **Roof**: Simple peaked design for single-span, multiple peaks for gutter-connect
- **Floor**: Green color to indicate greenhouse mode

## Testing
1. Create a room with dimensions: 30×96×14 ft
2. The 3D view should show:
   - Visible frame structure (gray posts and beams)
   - Semi-transparent glass walls and roof
   - Green floor
   - No black box or NaN errors

## Structure Types
- **single-span**: Single peaked roof, suitable for smaller greenhouses
- **gutter-connect**: Multiple bays with gutters between, for larger commercial greenhouses

The greenhouse should now render correctly as a recognizable glass structure instead of a black box.
