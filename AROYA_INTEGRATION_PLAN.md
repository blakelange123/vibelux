# Aroya Integration Analysis & Development Plan

## Executive Summary
Aroya focuses on complete cultivation management with hardware sensors, while Vibelux excels at lighting design and virtual sensors. Combining these approaches would create a comprehensive cultivation platform.

## Priority 1: Environmental Monitoring Integration
### Features to Add:
- Temperature & humidity sensors integration
- VPD (Vapor Pressure Deficit) calculations and monitoring
- CO2 level tracking
- Real-time alerts for environmental anomalies

### Implementation:
```typescript
interface EnvironmentalData {
  temperature: number;
  humidity: number;
  vpd: number;
  co2: number;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

## Priority 2: Substrate Monitoring
### Features to Add:
- Water content (WC) monitoring
- Electrical conductivity (EC) tracking
- Root zone temperature
- Integration with popular sensors (TEROS, GRODAN)

## Priority 3: Irrigation Control
### Features to Add:
- Irrigation scheduling synchronized with photoperiods
- Fertigation recipe management
- Integration with OpenSprinkler and similar controllers
- Water usage analytics

## Priority 4: Crop Steering & Recipes
### Features to Add:
- Strain-specific lighting recipes
- Growth phase management (veg, flower, etc.)
- Digital grow journal
- Batch tracking from clone to harvest

## Priority 5: Yield Analytics
### Features to Add:
- Grams per watt calculations
- Yield per square foot tracking
- Energy cost per gram produced
- ROI dashboard connecting lighting to yields

## Competitive Advantages to Maintain:
1. **Virtual Sensor Technology**: Our unlimited virtual sensors vs their expensive hardware
2. **AI Lighting Design**: Natural language lighting assistant
3. **3D Visualization**: Advanced fixture placement and coverage modeling
4. **Cost Efficiency**: ~90% savings compared to hardware sensor grids

## Technical Implementation Plan:

### Phase 1: Environmental Integration (Weeks 1-4)
- Add environmental sensor API endpoints
- Create real-time monitoring dashboard
- Implement VPD calculations
- Build alert system

### Phase 2: Substrate & Irrigation (Weeks 5-8)
- Design substrate monitoring UI
- Create irrigation scheduling system
- Integrate with third-party controllers
- Add fertigation recipes

### Phase 3: Cultivation Management (Weeks 9-12)
- Build strain recipe system
- Create digital grow journal
- Implement batch tracking
- Add yield analytics

## Market Positioning:
"Vibelux: The only platform that combines AI-powered lighting design with complete environmental control - without the hardware costs."

## Revenue Opportunities:
1. Tiered subscriptions based on sensor integrations
2. Premium features for commercial growers
3. API access for third-party integrations
4. Consulting services for facility design
