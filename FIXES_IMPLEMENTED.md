# Fixes Implemented - Unified Pricing & Stripe Affiliate Payouts

## ‚úÖ **All Critical Issues Resolved**

### üîß **1. Unified Pricing Model** (`/src/lib/unified-pricing.ts`)

**Problem**: Conflicting subscription and revenue-sharing pricing systems.

**Solution**: Created `UnifiedPricingManager` that handles both models seamlessly.

#### Key Features:
- **Single Customer Model**: `UnifiedCustomer` interface handles both pricing approaches
- **Feature Resolution**: Revenue sharing customers get Professional-level features automatically
- **Billing Summary**: Unified interface shows appropriate billing info for each model
- **Upgrade Recommendations**: Smart suggestions based on usage patterns
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitors limits and provides enforcement

#### Core Functions:
```typescript
UnifiedPricingManager.getEffectiveFeatureLevel(customer)
UnifiedPricingManager.getCustomerFeatures(customer)
UnifiedPricingManager.getBillingSummary(customer, revenueData)
UnifiedPricingManager.getUpgradeRecommendation(customer, usage)
```

### üîß **2. Enhanced Affiliate System** (`/src/lib/affiliates/affiliate-system.ts`)

**Problem**: Commission calculations didn't account for different payment models.

**Solution**: Updated affiliate system with unified pricing support.

#### New Capabilities:
- **Dual Pricing Support**: Handles both subscription and revenue-sharing referrals
- **Enhanced Commissions**: 50% bonus for revenue-sharing referrals (long-term value)
- **Ongoing Revenue**: Tracks monthly revenue-sharing commissions
- **Payment Model Tracking**: Links customers to their referral source

#### Updated Functions:
```typescript
trackConversion(cookieData, conversionData) // Now supports paymentModel
calculateCommission(affiliate, conversionData) // Model-aware calculations
calculateOngoingCommission(affiliateId, customerId, monthlyRevenueShare)
```

### üîß **3. Stripe Connect Integration** (`/src/lib/stripe/affiliate-payouts.ts`)

**Problem**: No automated payout system for affiliates.

**Solution**: Complete Stripe Connect implementation with automated payouts.

#### Features Implemented:

```

### üîß **4. Updated Subscription Manager** (`/src/components/SubscriptionManager.tsx`)

**Problem**: Component only worked with traditional subscriptions.

**Solution**: Enhanced to display both subscription and revenue-sharing customers.

#### New Features:
- **Unified Display**: Shows appropriate billing info for each model
- **Model Switching**: Easy transition between pricing models
- **Enhanced Usage Tracking**: Displays limits based on effective feature level
- **Smart Actions**: Context-aware upgrade/management options

### üîß **5. API Endpoints** (`/src/app/api/affiliate/payout/route.ts`)

**Problem**: No API for processing affiliate payouts.
