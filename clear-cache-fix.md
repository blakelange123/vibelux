# React Three Fiber Error Fix

## Issue:
- Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ReactCurrentOwner')
- Related to @react-three/fiber trying to load from a file that doesn't exist (Enhanced3DCanvasR3F.tsx)

## Solution:
1. Cleared Next.js build cache by removing `.next` directory
2. The error is from a stale webpack chunk trying to load a file that was likely removed earlier

## To complete the fix:
1. Restart the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. If the error persists, also clear node_modules cache:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules/.cache
   ```

3. The application is using the standard Three.js implementation in `ThreeJS3DVisualization.tsx` which doesn't require React Three Fiber, so this error should disappear after clearing the cache.

## Note:
The greenhouse rendering improvements are already implemented in the existing Three.js visualization component and don't require React Three Fiber.
