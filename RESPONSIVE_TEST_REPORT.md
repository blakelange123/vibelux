```javascript
// Real-time viewport detection
const updateViewport = () => {
  const width = window.innerWidth
  const height = window.innerHeight
  setViewport({ width, height })
  
  // Device type detection
  if (width < 640) setDeviceType('Mobile')
  else if (width < 1024) setDeviceType('Tablet')
  else setDeviceType('Desktop')
}
```

### 2. Responsive Component Testing
