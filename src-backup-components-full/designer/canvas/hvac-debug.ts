  /*
  ðŸ”§ MANUAL DEBUGGING STEPS:
  1. In React DevTools, find the DesignerProvider component
  2. Look at its state.objects array
  3. Filter for objects with type === 'equipment'
  4. Check their x, y, width, and length properties

  ðŸ”§ QUICK TEST:
  1. Press 'E' key to select all equipment
  2. If equipment gets selected (yellow outline), the objects exist
  3. Try using arrow keys to move them
  4. Or press 'M' for move mode and try dragging

  ðŸ”§ COORDINATE TEST:
  1. Note the room dimensions (shown in status bar)
  2. Check if equipment x,y are within room bounds
  3. Equipment at center would be at (roomWidth/2, roomLength/2)
