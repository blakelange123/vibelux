### 🔧 Technical Implementation Requirements

#### 1. Affiliate Account Setup
```typescript
// Create Connected Account for Affiliate
const account = await stripe.accounts.create({
  type: 'express', // Simplified onboarding
  country: 'US',
  email: affiliateEmail,
  capabilities: {
    transfers: { requested: true }
  }
});
```

#### 2. Commission Tracking & Payouts
```typescript
// Track referral conversion
const payment = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: 5000, // $50.00 customer payment
  currency: 'usd',
  transfer_group: `{ORDER_ID}`,
});

// Automatic affiliate payout (20% commission)
const transfer = await stripe.transfers.create({
  amount: 1000, // $10.00 affiliate commission
  currency: 'usd',
  destination: affiliateAccountId,
  transfer_group: `{ORDER_ID}`,
});
```

#### 3. Revenue Sharing Integration
Our revenue-sharing model is **perfectly compatible** with Stripe Connect:
- Track monthly revenue sharing payments from customers
- Calculate affiliate commissions (20-30% of revenue share)
- Automatically transfer commissions to affiliate accounts
- Generate tax documentation

## 🟡 Subscription Tier Analysis - NEEDS MINOR ADJUSTMENTS

### Current Tier Structure Assessment

#### ✅ **Well-Designed Tiers**
1. **Free Explorer** ($0) - Good entry point
2. **Hobbyist** ($9/mo) - Appropriate for home growers  
3. **Grower** ($19/mo) - Strong value proposition
4. **Professional** ($49/mo) - Comprehensive for commercial use
5. **Enterprise** ($149/mo) - Full-featured for large operations

#### ⚠️ **Functional Issues Identified**

**1. Revenue Sharing Tier Conflict**
```typescript
// CURRENT ISSUE: Two different pricing systems
const subscriptionTiers = SAFE_SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS; // Fixed monthly pricing
const revenueSharingModels = REVENUE_SHARING_MODELS; // Performance-based pricing
```

**2. Feature Access Logic Gaps**
```typescript
// MISSING: How revenue sharing customers access subscription features
if (customer.plan === 'revenue-sharing') {
  // Which subscription tier features do they get?
  // Current code doesn't handle this scenario
}
```

**3. Affiliate Commission Calculation**
```typescript
// CURRENT: Simple percentage model
const commission = orderValue * affiliateRate; // 20-30%

// ISSUE: No consideration for customer's payment model
// Revenue sharing customers pay differently than subscription customers
```

### 🔧 **Required Fixes**

#### 1. Unified Pricing Model
```typescript
interface UnifiedCustomer {
  id: string;
  paymentModel: 'subscription' | 'revenue-sharing';
  subscriptionTier?: string;
  revenueSharingPlan?: string;
  effectiveFeatureLevel: 'free' | 'hobbyist' | 'grower' | 'professional' | 'enterprise';
}
```

#### 2. Feature Access Resolution
```typescript
function getCustomerFeatures(customer: UnifiedCustomer): string[] {
  if (customer.paymentModel === 'subscription') {
    return SAFE_SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS.find(t => t.id === customer.subscriptionTier)?.features || [];
  } else {
    // Revenue sharing customers get Professional-level features
    return SAFE_SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS.find(t => t.id === 'professional')?.features || [];
  }
}
```

#### 3. Commission Calculation Fix
```typescript
function calculateAffiliateCommission(customer: Customer, monthlyRevenue: number): number {
  if (customer.paymentModel === 'subscription') {
    // Commission on subscription revenue
    return customer.monthlyPayment * affiliateRate;
  } else {
    // Commission on revenue sharing payments
    return monthlyRevenue * vibeluxShare * affiliateRate;
  }
}
```
