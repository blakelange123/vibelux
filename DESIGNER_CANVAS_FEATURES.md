# Designer Canvas Features Implementation ✅

## Summary
Successfully implemented all "coming soon" designer canvas features including properties panel, grouping, layer ordering, and equipment placement guidance.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Properties Panel Component
**File**: `/src/components/designer/panels/PropertiesPanel.tsx`

**Features**:
- **General Section**: Custom name, enabled/disabled toggle, lock/unlock
- **Transform Section**: 
  - Position (X, Y, Z) with precise input
  - Size (Width, Length, Height) controls
  - Rotation with degree input
- **Type-Specific Properties**:
  - Fixtures: Model, wattage, PPF display
  - Equipment: Type, capacity info
  - Plants: Plant type, growth stage selection
- **Actions**: Duplicate object, delete object
- Collapsible sections with smooth transitions
- Real-time updates to canvas

### 2. Grouping Functionality
**File**: `/src/components/designer/utils/grouping.ts`

**Features**:
- Create groups from multiple selected objects
- Group management (add/remove objects)
- Group bounds calculation
- Move groups as single unit
- Rotate groups around center
- Scale groups proportionally

**Implementation**:
- Right-click → Group creates new group
- Objects tagged with group ID
- Visual feedback on group creation

### 3. Layer Ordering (Z-Index)
**File**: `/src/components/designer/utils/layering.ts`

**Features**:
- Bring to Front / Send to Back
- Bring Forward / Send Backward (one level)
- Auto-arrange by object type
- Reorder by dragging in future layers panel
- Proper rendering order maintained

**Implementation**:
- Objects sorted by z-index before rendering
- Context menu actions update z-index
- Visual stacking order respected

### 4. Equipment Placement Fix
- "Equipment placement coming soon" → Opens equipment panels
- Guides users to select from right sidebar
- Clear notification about workflow

### 5. Canvas Updates
**File**: `/src/components/designer/canvas/SimpleCanvas2D.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Integrated PropertiesPanel component
- Added z-index sorting to render loop
- Connected context menu to new features
- State management for groups and properties

## Technical Details

### State Management:
```typescript
// New state variables
const [showPropertiesPanel, setShowPropertiesPanel] = useState(false);
const [objectGroups, setObjectGroups] = useState<any[]>([]);
```

### Z-Index Rendering:
```typescript
// Sort objects by z-index before rendering
const sortedObjects = [...objects].sort((a, b) => {
  const aZIndex = (a as any).zIndex || 0;
  const bZIndex = (b as any).zIndex || 0;
  return aZIndex - bZIndex;
});
```

## Impact:
✅ Professional CAD-like object manipulation
✅ Intuitive property editing interface
✅ Layer management for complex designs
✅ Group operations for efficiency
✅ No more "coming soon" embarrassments

## Future Enhancements:
1. Layers panel for visual layer management
2. Group hierarchy (nested groups)
3. Batch property editing
4. Advanced transform tools (mirror, array)
5. Property animation/transitions
