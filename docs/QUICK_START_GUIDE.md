## Step 3: Design Your Lighting Layout

### Using the Basic Designer

1. **Go to** Design → Basic Designer
2. **Set room dimensions**:
   ```
   Length: 32 ft
   Width: 25 ft
   Height: 12 ft
   Mounting Height: 8 ft
   ```

3. **Choose fixtures** from our database:
   - Browse 2,400+ DLC-certified LED fixtures
   - Filter by manufacturer (Fluence, Philips, etc.)
   - Select based on wattage and efficacy

4. **Place fixtures** on the canvas:
   - Drag fixtures from the library
   - Use grid snap for precise positioning
   - Adjust spacing for uniformity

5. **Analyze results**:
   - View PPFD heatmap
   - Check uniformity ratio (target: <10% CV)
   - Review energy consumption

---

## Step 4: Use the PPFD Calculator

### Quick PPFD Calculation

1. **Navigate** to Calculators → PPFD Calculator
2. **Enter fixture specifications**:
   ```
   Fixture: Fluence SPYDR 2x (685W)
   Mounting Height: 8 ft
   Beam Angle: 120°
   ```

3. **Set calculation area**:
   ```
   Area: 4 ft × 4 ft
   Grid Resolution: 6 inches
   ```

4. **Review results**:
   - Center PPFD: ~800 μmol/m²/s
   - Edge PPFD: ~400 μmol/m²/s
   - Uniformity ratio: 0.5 (50%)

### Target PPFD Ranges
- **Seedlings**: 100-200 μmol/m²/s
- **Vegetative**: 200-400 μmol/m²/s
- **Flowering**: 600-1000 μmol/m²/s

## Step 5: Calculate DLI Requirements

### Daily Light Integral Calculator

1. **Go to** Calculators → DLI Calculator
2. **Select your crop**:
   ```
   Crop Type: Cannabis
   Growth Stage: Flowering
   Target DLI: 50 mol/m²/day
   ```

3. **Set photoperiod**:
   ```
   Light Hours: 12 hours/day
   Dark Hours: 12 hours/day
   ```

4. **Calculate required PPFD**:
   ```
   Required PPFD = 50 ÷ (12 × 0.0036) = 1,157 μmol/m²/s
   ```

## Step 6: Try the AI Assistant

### Get Design Recommendations

1. **Navigate** to Design → AI Assistant
2. **Ask a question**:
   ```
   "Design a 1000 sq ft cannabis flowering room with 
   target PPFD of 800 μmol/m²/s using Fluence fixtures 
   with a budget of $15,000"
   ```

3. **Review AI recommendations**:
   - Fixture selection and quantity
   - Optimal spacing and layout
   - Energy efficiency analysis
   - Cost breakdown

### Example AI Prompts
```
"What PPFD do I need for lettuce production?"
"How many fixtures for a 20×40 ft greenhouse?"
"Compare LED vs HPS for tomato growing"
"Calculate heat load for 50kW of LED fixtures"
```
