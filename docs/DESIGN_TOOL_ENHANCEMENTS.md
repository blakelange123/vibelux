- Performance metrics

## 🎨 **Technical Implementation**

### **Fixture Renderer System**
```typescript
// Professional rendering system
export const FIXTURE_STYLES: { [key: string]: FixtureStyle } = {
  led_panel: { /* detailed drawing function */ },
  led_strip: { /* linear fixture rendering */ },
  high_bay: { /* circular industrial design */ },
  // ... etc
}
```

### **Smart Style Detection**
- Automatic style selection based on model name
- User override capability
- Persistent style storage
- Context-aware defaults

### **Advanced Canvas Drawing**
- Professional 2D canvas techniques
- Layered rendering (cones behind fixtures)
- Gradient lighting effects
- Detailed geometric patterns

## 📊 **Impact on User Experience**

### **Professional Appearance**
- Fixtures now look like actual products
- Plans appear more professional
- Better client presentations
- Industry-standard visualization

### **Better Design Understanding**
- Clear fixture type identification
- Realistic spacing visualization
- Proper scale representation
- Professional documentation quality

### **Enhanced Functionality**
- Style selection for different applications
- Fixture-specific optimizations
- Better planning accuracy
- Professional-grade output

## 🔄 **Comparison: Before vs After**

### **Before (Generic)**
```
┌─────────┐  ← Simple yellow rectangle
│  Light  │  ← No detail or realism
└─────────┘  ← One-size-fits-all
```

### **After (Professional)**
```
╭─────────────────────╮  ← Detailed aluminum frame
│ ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● │  ← LED grid pattern
│ ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● │  ← Mounting holes
